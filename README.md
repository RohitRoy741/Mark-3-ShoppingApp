#Introduction
Hello everybody, this project named Mark 3 is a command line shopping application that works locally on your machine using text files to store data. The appliation alothough primitive can be used to demonstrate several features of popular shopping applications like Amazon and flipkart. 
#Features
Some of the features of the application include:-
1. Login and registering facilities that creates your own text files named with your username. The text file stores the record of all your purchases with date and time.
2. You can access the items database to see the complete list of items. This feature stimulates admin like facilities.
3. Cart feature is also available, i.e, you can move your items to the cart and then purchase them or remove them.
#Usage
Download all the source code and text files in a folder on your machine then compile and run "Main.java". Viola, you are good to go. Create your account to toy around with the features. Any suggestions are welcome
#Notes
1. This was my java project for college so I didn't try to make it more complex by adding features like using a dbms system,etc.
2. I am planning to develop such an application for integrating all the shops and their services in small localites as the clusters. Such a step would provide means to small bussinessmen to compete with large firms as well as help people to buy the groceries from the ones they trust.
3. Currently I am working on re-writing this application in Python to add more features easily.
